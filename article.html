					<li><p>This article has talked about different aspects of Mail Art and how it played a row in the communication between artists.</p></li>
					<li><p>Mail Art began in the 1960s when artists sent postcards inscribed with poems or drawings through the post rather than exhibiting or selling them through conventional commercial channels. Mail art and can take a variety of forms including postcards, packages, faxes, emails and blogs. It is considered to be the predecessor of net art.</p></li>
					<li><p>It is like this assignment we did where we linked our room to other classmates' room. We can share our thoughts with each others just by simply clicking a buttom.</p></li>
					<li><p>In Line 31, it has mentioned that 'Art is money.' It reminds me of a reading that I did long time ago, which has talked about the comercial value of the artworks in museums. Nowadays, most of the people will think that an artwork that worth a lot of money is good art. However, in order for it to worth a lot of money, the artwork itself needs to be "good art". So the question is how can an artwork be determined as "good art"? </p></li>
